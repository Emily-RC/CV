## Skills

#### Problem Solving
As Membership Manager at Work.Life I was really able to demonstrate my problem-solving skills. Having inherited a coworking space that was 41% occupied I undertook a systematic approach. I was able to analyse the multi-layered issues on a large scale and break these down to manageable components. This led to occupancy levels reaching 100% against a goal of 90%. Furthermore, I regularly resolved day-to-day problems such as contract negotiation, troubleshooting technical issues, and facilitating conflict resolution. 

#### Project Management 
During my role as Manager, Partner Services at CLIA I led the successful implementation of a new CRM system (Aptify). This involved a rigorous initiation and planning process in order to roll out smoothly across several teams with varying requirements. Agile methodologies aided the continual betterment of the project throughout. In addition, this project inspired a new love for technology in the workplace and provided an opportunity to hone valuable technical skills. 

#### Collaboration 
Collaboration has been a skill continuously developed during my education and further refined throughout my career. I enjoy knowledge sharing and during my time at Makers Academy, collaborative coding was integral to our group projects. At Work.Life effective collaboration was paramount to sales successes and high levels of retention by working closely with the commercial director, marketing team, other membership managers and external suppliers. 

#### Additional Skills 
CRM (Nexudus, Aptify), Hubspot, Leadership, SPSS Statistics, Xero financial management, PnL, forecasting, revenue & budget management, team leadership, PRINCE2: Foundation & Practitioner in Project Management
